## Summary

The public transit system grows and the number of bus lines increases as response to the growing needs from commuters. However, it also causes confusions regarding the arriving buses, bus lines available at a certain stop and how soon the desired bus arrives. The goal of BusyBus is to provide users clear information on bus schedule and real-time location for a better commuting experience.
